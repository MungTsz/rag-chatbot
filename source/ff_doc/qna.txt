What is Algorithmic Trading?	
Algorithmic trading, also known as automated trading, is the practice of defining and describing one's financial operations in a clear manner and executing trades in a disciplined manner, following pre-defined rules.

There are various forms of algorithmic trading. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) defines program trading as the simultaneous trading of a basket of 15 or more index component stocks with a total value exceeding $1 million. These portfolio trades are executed simultaneously. In simple terms, algorithmic trading involves simultaneously buying or selling a basket of stocks. There are also a few hybrid program trades that involve both buying and selling stocks. Buying a basket of stocks simultaneously is referred to as program buying, while selling a basket of stocks simultaneously is referred to as program selling.

Algorithmic trading is primarily used by large institutions. They buy or sell entire stock portfolios simultaneously or nearly simultaneously, and the buying and selling programs can be used to achieve various objectives.

Why not start trading directly with a real account?	
You should first test your abilities on a demo account and prove your skills before trading with real money.

It is recommended for everyone to test their strategies on a demo account first.

What happens if I lose internet connection in a short period of time?	
If you have set profit and stop-loss levels before placing the order, losing internet connection for a short period of time will not affect the system's settings. If you are using a VPS (Virtual Private Server), as long as the internet reconnects within a short period of time, it will not impact the system.
