General Questions 
How do I install expert advisors or indicators from the mql5.com market?

Kindly read my installation guide.

How do I update expert advisors or indicators from the mql5.com market to latest versions?

The procedure is identical to the installation, but instead of the "Install" button, you should click the "Update" button (it will be available if an update is available).

The free download button is not working!

In order to install a free product, you need to find it in the Market and click "Download". After that, the product will immediately appear in the "Market" list of the Navigator (View => Navigator).

Do I have to pay for future updates?

No, updates are free.
